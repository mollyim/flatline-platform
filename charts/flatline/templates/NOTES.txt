ðŸš§ WARNING ðŸš§

The Flatline project is a work in progress.

This chart and its resources are unstable in order to facilitate development.

During development, several features will be disabled or insecurely implemented.

Do not run this in production environments.

Please, wait for the Whisper service to become ready. You can monitor this with the following command:

$ kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} deployment/{{ include "common.fullname" .}}-whisper-service --for=condition=Available

{{ if .Values.traefikResources.enabled -}}
